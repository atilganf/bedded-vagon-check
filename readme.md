# Bedded Vagon Check

### Problem
I have to travel long distance. And most comfortable way of doing it 
is with TCDD bedded vaggons

But if tickets wont be bought really early. 
I need to check if someone cancel their tickets constantly

### Solution
Write a scrapping script for checking and logging bedded vaggon statuses

### To Start
install dependencies with `npm install` 

start the script with `node main`

You can check the progress from `example.png` file and from `command line`
